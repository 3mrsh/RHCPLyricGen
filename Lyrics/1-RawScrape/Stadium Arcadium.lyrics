#1. Dani California
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Getting born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper
And Mama was a hippie

In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

She never knew that there was
Anything more than poor

What in the world does your
Company take me for

Black bandana sweet Louisiana
Robbin' a bank in the state of Indiana

She’s a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin’
Baby watcha gonna

Looking down the barrel of a
Hot metal 45
Just another way to survive

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show me your teeth
She’s my priestess; I'm your priest

She’s a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin’ when
It got a little brighter

With a name like Dani California
The day was gonna come
When I was gonna mourn ya

A little loaded she was
Stealin’ another breath
I love my baby to death

Who knew the other side of you
Who knew what others died to prove
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say say say

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later

Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin'
For the quota

Down in the Badlands
She was savin’ the best for last

It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

#2. Snow ((Hey Oh))
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on

When I sit alone come get a little more known
But I need more than myself this time

Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on

When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh listen what I say oh
I got your
Hey oh listen what I say oh

When will I know that I really can’t go
To the well one more time to decide on

When it’s killing me
When will I really see
All that I need to look inside

Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride

When it’s killing me
What do I really need
All that I need to look inside

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go…hey oh

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it’s so white as snow

Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there’s nowhere to go

In beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it’s so white as snow

Running through a field where all my tracks will
Be concealed and there is nowhere to go

When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down

Now you bring it up
I’m gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out

Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on

When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

-----------

#3. Charlie
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

All aboard……stitch in time
Get yours……got mine
In a minute……I’ll be there
Sit tight……get square
You could do at the Hippodrome
Slide back……trombone
Anybody got a TV tome
That’s right……unknown

When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman save me some
Better get up on your run

So much more than
Charlie’s wakin’ me
To my core and
Charlie's shakin' me
And tell my story
And Charlie’s makin’ me
And Charlie’s makin’ me smile
Oh oh now

Everybody……Do the twist
Get the message……on Flea’s fist
Move around like a scientist
Lay down……get kissed
Big picture and it never lies
Big daddy……will advise
Eveready……in disguise
Sunset………sunrise

My heart……your skin
This love……I’m in
We don’t arrive without a surprise
Your’re right……I’m wrong
Be free…………belong
Intimate sight has come in to light

All I ever wanted to
Was pick it up and run with you
Slip into a summer spell
Double up and run like hell

-----------

#4. Stadium Arcadium
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Bells around St. Petersburg
When I saw you

I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find

Smoke surrounds your perfect face
And I’m falling

Pushing a broom out into space
And this is where I find a way

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
I’m forming I’m warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
I’m forming I’m warming
Pushing myself
And no I don’t mind asking
Now

Alone inside my forest room
And it’s storming

I never thought I’d be in bloom
But this is where I start

Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd
That it cannot phase
And I’m calling

Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs
And I’m sorry

And this is where I find

Rays of dust that wrap around
Your citizen

Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand

-----------

#5. Hump de Bump
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

40 detectives a week
40 detectives strong
Takin’ a stroll down Love Street
Strollin’ is that so wrong
Can I get my co-defendant

Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu

Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bomp doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu

Bump bump

Must have been a hundred miles
Any of a hundred styles
It’s not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was an all aloner
Nothin’ but a two-beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I’m wide awake now

Workin’ the beat as we speak
Working the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believin’, is that so wrong
Can I get my co-dependent

Listen to me what I said
Try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance
A chance to make out

Livin’ in a citadel
It’s hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll
And I am wide awake now

-----------

#6. She�s Only 18
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

She's only 18
Don’t like the Rolling Stones
She took a short cut
To being fully grown

She's got that mood ring
A little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose

This talking picture show
Is leaking from a silhouette
She said my man you know
It’s time to get your fingers wet
Your hustle’s busted when
You can’t afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you
You were screaming
“Handle it”

Knock the world right off its feet
And straight onto its head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the
Brightest minds and light will shed

I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk
Is what I recommend

It’s in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I’m gonna make you mine

It’s understood you wrap
Your voodoo right around my neck
You’ve got some glitter on your
Kitty at the discotheque
I put my lovin’ in your oven
Not a head to check
The last I heard from you
You were screaming
“Resurrect”

-----------

#7. Slow Cheetah
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Waking up dead inside of my head
Will never never do there is no med
No medicine to take

I’ve had a chance to be insane
Asylum from the falling rain
I’ve had a chance to break

It’s so bad it’s got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake

Any other day and I might play
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away

Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it’s on today

Slow cheetah come
It’s so euphoric
No matter what they say

I know a girl
She worked in a store
She knew not what
Her life was for
She barely knew her name

They tried to tell her
She would never be
As happy as the girl
In the magazine
She bought it with her pay

Everyone has
So much to say
They talk talk talk
Their lives away
Don’t even hesitate

Walking on down
To the burial ground
It’s a very old dance
With a merry old sound
Looks like it’s on today

-----------

#8. Torture Me
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Because I’m happy to be sad
I want it all I want it bad
Oh-oh – it’s what I know

A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near

Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me
Torture me with sorcery
It's forcin’ me so torture me

All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go – it's what I know

The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill
Let’s go...

Let’s turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound
Is so...

A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
It’s so...

-----------

#9. Strip My Mind
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Arthur J did indicate
The boulevard would never be
So full of love and life again

Hot as Hades early eighties
Sing another song and make me
Feel like I’m in love again

Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind

All in favor sign the waiver
Bloody Carolina won't you
Take another look inside

Operator, co-creator
Come on radiator won't you
Blow another top and sing

El Dorado won the lotto
All that cash and not a clue
But now you know what I've been through

-----------

#10. Especially In Michigan
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Life is my friend
Rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon
Especially in Michigan
……well I could be your friend

White clouds I'm in
A mitten full of fisherman
C'mon Huckleberry Finn
Show me how to make her grin
........well I’m in Michigan

Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

A rainy Lithuanian
Who's dancing as an Indian
Painted in my tiger skin
(Especially in Michigan)

Double chins and bowling pins
Unholy Presbyterians
Land is full of medicine
I find it when I’m slipping in
.......into Michigan

The tainted new librarian
Who fainted when she tucked you in
Let's float away like zeppelins
(On stoic gusts of Northern wind)

Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

Life is my friend
Underwater violins
Order now from Ho Chi Min
A porcelain that comes in twins
…………When I'm in Michigan

Throw me in the looney bin
‘Cause I can take it on the chin
The cleavage of your pillow skin
(Is moving like a violin)

-----------

#11. Warlocks
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Warlocks in wonderland
I’ve gotta megatropolis in my hand
And a…subterranean marching band
Makin’ noise for the boys in the Vatican
And a

A little package and off we go
Oh…..ticky ticky tackita tic tac toe
I know….everybody’s Eskimo
We’ve got another thing coming
And that’s our show….well

Every night I go looking for you
Everyone in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind
To find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for
Look at me and it’s what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy
That we believe in

Lilacs and contraband
I’ve got Santa Monica in my hand
A little…..Beatlemania when I can
And I’ve got two big bags of old Japan

Ring side and blow-by-blow
Another…main event at the old rainbow
Were comin’…Right on top of the tupelo
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot

Make a deal with Uncle Weezer
Sign your name to claim
China Chow will try to please her
Sweetness came from Jane

Warlocks in wonderland
I’ve gotta….Rockapotomus in my hand
With a….Happy ending that’s made of sand
With a little bit of lovin’ is all I can

#12. C�mon Girl
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Everything inside of me
Is burning up for you to see

And if we should get into it
A two way kind of syndicate, ho

Compare us to a Ferris wheel
Just be sure of what you want to steal
Some people do it by the book
But I prefer to go by feel, tell me

I wanted to get outta here
But every time I reappear
And know I have the words my dear
To whisper right into your ear, hey, yeah

C’mon girl
Let’s get it right
Let’s get it right
Let’s get it right

The spirit of a dragon’s tear
Is lovely at this time of year

The cave within your mountainside
Is deeper than it will be wide hold me

My disenchanted diplomat
Asleep inside the laundromat
Conveyer belts are moving and
I want you to be sure of that, tell me

And if you let it germinate
I know it will be worth the wait
Disputed by the news that it was you
Who tried to instigate, hey

Blessed are the hypocrites
Outwitted but she never quits
The trouble with a band of slits
Is washing off the muddy bits, hey…….yeah

Oh yeah, she’s with me and I’m your man
If I can’t find you no one can

-----------

#13. Wet Sand
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

My shadow side so amplified
Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary son but it’s so…..

My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent why do you care
Someone start the car
Time to go…you’re the best I know

My sunny side has up and died
I’m betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low

The travesties that we have seen
Are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro

My what a good day
For a walk outside
I’d like to get to know
You a little better baby
God knows that I really tried

My what a good day
For a take out bride
I’d like to say we
Did it for the better of

I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary son but its so

The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty
Going toe to toe

My what a good day
Just to let it slide
I’d like to say we did it for the better of

I thought about it
And I brought it out
I’m motivated by the lack of doubt
I’m consecrated but I’m not devout
The mother the father the daughter

Right on the verge just one more dose
I’m traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn’t perfect but its close

I’m almost there why should I care
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up and
Let it show

My what a good day
For a walk outside
I’d like to think we did it for the better of

You don’t form in the wet sand
You don’t form at all
You don’t form in the wet sand
I do  Yeah
You don’t form in the wet sand
You don’t form at all
You don’t form in the wet sand
I do

#14. Hey
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Won't somebody come along
And teach me how to keep it alive
To survive

Come along and show me something
That I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet

I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But now I walk alone and talk about it, when I know

Hey awe yeah  how long
I guess I oughta walk away
Hey awe yeah  so long
Whatcha gonna do today

I don’t want to have to but I will
If that’s what I am supposed to do
We don’t wanna set up for the kill
But that’s what I am about to do

Later on I’ll cut you off
When you’re screaming into the phone
Hard to own

Anyway I want to let you know
That everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me

You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But now you’re quick to get into your regret
Take a fall and now you got to give it all away

Hey, what would you say if I stay
Stay for a while if I may
Say it again and I’ll come around
But not for the last time
Hey, what would you say if I change
Change everything but my name
Play it again and I’ll come around, come around
But not for the last time, not for the last time

You used to be so warm and affectionate
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
And now you're quick to get into your regret
But now I walk alone and talk about it, when I know

#15. Desecration Smile
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

All alone not by myself
Another girl bad for my health
I’ve seen it all thru someone else
(Another girl bad for my health)

Celebrated but undisturbed
Serenaded by the terror bird
It’s seldom seen but it’s never heard
(Serenaded by the terror bird)

Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face my face
Disintegrated by the rising sun
A rolling black out of oblivion
And I’d like to think that I’m your #1
(I’m rolling black out of oblivion)

I wanna leave but I just get stuck
A broken record runnin’ low on luck
There’s heavy metal coming from your truck
I’m a (a broken record runnin’ low on luck)

We could all go down to
Malibu and make some noise
Coca Cola doesn’t do the justice
She enjoys
We could all come up with
Something new to be destroyed
We could all go down

I love the feeling when it falls apart
I’m slow to finish but I’m quick to start and
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark
And I’m
(Slow to finish but I am quick to start)

#16. Tell Me Baby
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do

No turning water into wine
No learning while you’re in the line
I’ll take you to the broken sign
You see the lights are blue

Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye
‘Cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody
Lookin’ for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away
Can’t take it for another minute

This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it’s only promising
This place was made on you

Tell me baby what’s your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time
Tell me lover are you lonely
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me baby what’s your story
Where do you come from
And where you wanna go this time
You’re so lovely are you lonely
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed

I’ll move you like a baritone
Jungle brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It’s time to turn to stone

Chitty chitty baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life could be a little sweet
But life could be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fitty

Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

-----------

#17. Hard To Concentrate
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Hustle, bustle and so much muscle awww
Cells about to separate
And I find it hard to concentrate and

Temporary this cash and carry
I’m stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate and

All I want is for you to be happy and
Take this moment to make you my family and
Finally you have found something perfect and
Finally you have found
Death defying this mess I’m buying
It’s raining down with love and hate
And I find it hard to motivate and

Estuary is blessed but scary your
Heart’s about to palpitate
And I’m not about to hesitate and

One to treasure the rest of your days here and
Give you pleasure in so many ways dear and
Finally you have found something perfect and
Finally you have found……..here we go

Do you want me to show up for duty and
Serve this woman and honor her beauty and
Finally you have found something perfect and
Finally you have found……yourself

With me……will you…agree…to take
This man…into your world…
And now…we are as one…

My lone ranger the heat exchanger
Is living in this figure eight
And I’ll do my best to recreate and

Sweet precision and soft collision awww
Hearts about to palpitate
And I find it hard to separate and

All I want is for you to be happy and
Take this woman and make you my family and
Finally you have found someone perfect and
Finally you have found……yourself

#18. 21st Century
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

All the creatures on the beaches
Making waves in the motion picture

Won't you keep this in between us
Search and seizure wake up Venus

The dollar bill will mentally ill bill
Mom and dad take your don't be sad pill

Turn the screw and twist my language
Don't forsake me I'm contagious

There's a reason
For the 21st century
Not too sure
But I know that it's
Meant to be
And that it's meant to be

It's my favorite combination
Coming down with the favored nations
Deep rotation mutilation
Learn to give and take dictation
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, like Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, gonna to run this table

Read me your scripture now
Read me your scripture
Read me your scripture and I will twist it

Show me your wrist and I
Show me your wrist and
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it kiss it

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, like Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, gonna to run this table

Simple soldier hand it over
Stop and read what you just wrote her

Strangulation altercation
Oral sex and bird migration

#19. She Looks To Me
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Looks to me like heaven sent
No lullaby kid no 5%

Any way you want to cut that cake
She's dyin' from the likes of abandonment

Lost in the valley without my horses
She needs somebody to hold

It looks to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me all right

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me all right

It's a long walk down those tracks
It's a dirty walk in
It's a dirty walk back
Gonna learn aww way too much
Shootin' dope in the back
Of a Cadillac Jack

Slow down the road to my back 40
She needs somebody to hold

Down in the South seas
Give me your mouth please
Resuscitation
Is the way I find these
I give you major
You give me minor
Don't fade away
Like an ocean liner
Now

Lost in the valley
Without my horses
No one can tell me
What my remorse is

God made this lady
That stands before me
She needs somebody to hold

She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me she looks to me all right

Down on the bathroom floor
She's searching for another light
She looks to me she looks to me all right

#20. Readymade
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Readymade readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade readymade
And this is how the story goes

I gotta cousin making beats
Deep down in Arizona

We're gonna rock it to Ramone’s
In the city of Pomona

And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night
Come get it

Readymade readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade readymade
And now it's time to deviate

I've gotta sister making babies
With a Black and Decker blow torch

We're gonna fop it all night
In the middle of the back porch

Readymade readymade
Rockin' for the sake of slade
Readymade readymade
Listen but don't be afraid

I've gotta brother making trouble
In the state of Caledonia

I wish I knew another way
But I’m gonna have to clone ya

#21. If
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

And if I had a clue I'd know exactly
What to do
If I were the wiser of the two

And if I saw it all so clear
I'd write it down and bend your ear
If I were the clearer of the two

We could take a walk into the
Canyons of 5th Avenue
Sing and dance…
Just to name a few

All I do

And if I heard the angels sing I'd
Sing it back to you and bring the
Sound of heaven ringing just for you

And if I saw the sun fall down
I'd pick it up and make a crown
One that was a perfect fit for you

We could take a walk
Into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue

We could find a place to stay
A secret little hide away
Spend a little time inside of you

All I do

All eyes
All eyes on you

All I do

#22. Make You Feel Better
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

She's the one she's the only one
She's got ripped back light
Gonna make me come
I say…when I smile
I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile

I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
‘Cause that's what we do

Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me
And that is why I

Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire
Jump up to meet

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Oh yeah

In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights
Just to get struck

I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth
And a pack of style

I say…she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself
Until I'm done…and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars
Make a diagram…and

So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind
For the red on rust…I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me gonna hear my prayers
I said

#23. Animal Bar
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Never 21 when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever loving mug of Mr. Norman Mailer
Turn another page at the Animal Bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

I    I    I  the cry of isolation
I    I    I  the high of meditation
I    I    I  for sweet precipitation
I    I    I  the high of deprivation

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain foresaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
Runnin' through the mud
I got a feeling of worth

All aboard the ship
'Cause you're gonna need an ark
When the wet comes down
You'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the pain and
I'm a little older
The song of rain
At the Animal Bar

Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water the water the water
Saving us from the heat

Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
Fire will come find its day
The water the water the water
Washing it all away

#24. So Much I
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Next stop on the KLM
Two lips and a sturdy stem
A funny thing always happens when
I get a heavy jam
I'm gonna turn it into hydrogen
I   I,   I   I,    I   I,     I   I   I    I,       I

Cowgirl and a troubadour
MGM and the lion's roar
A straight shot to the corner store
I wanna show you what
I wanna show you what your head is for
I   I,   I   I,    I   I,     I   I   I    I,       I

So much I    wish I could
So many I    wish I would
So much I    wish I could
Count on you not to complete me
So much I    wish I could
So many I    wish I would
So much I    wish I could
Count on you not to defeat me

Please don't turn away again
Please don't turn me into them
Please don't turn away a friend
Please don't turn me into them

Stand by for the great eclipse
Rip it out now shake your hips
Backing off the apocalypse
I gotta loosen up
I gotta loosen up to get my grip
I   I,   I   I,    I   I,     I   I   I    I,       I

Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Come on come on baby
Let me show you what I'm talkin' about

You try to be a lady
But you're walkin' like a sour kraut

Looka looka lika lika
Like you want to get some

If you never tell a lie
Then you'll never have to play dumb

Dirty baby time you're gonna take some
Pretty baby love you're gonna make some
Little lady hearts you're gonna break some
Kinda shady tears you're gonna fake some

Dirty baby we’ve got a situation
Pretty baby open invitation
Little lady what a reputation
Kinda shady now you're gonna make again

I know you can straddle
The atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
I know you can battle the
Masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup girl

Every other day you say
You're gonna have to bury 'em

Famous last words
Spoken from the laserium

Descendants had a record
Sayin' somethin' 'bout Milo

You can take the A train
But you're gonna have to lie low

#26. We Believe
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

The curtain
Is open
A head to
Put dope in
Now we will
Come clean it
The future
We've seen it
No, no, I know, I said, no no

It's like a dream
That falls away
Into the night
Where we can play
I'm on a train
One happy day
Two eyes for sight
Three times I pray

Soda pop
We've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes
We've got a pressure drop
We don't know
But everyday I go
To see what I can bring
Into a cameo
Oh oh oh no

We believe
Climb a tree
For monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a Quaker

The mission
The method
The downfall
Arrested
'Cuz it's not
The first time
Nor is it
The worst time
No no oh no

To see the bird
Without a care
For in a word
It's nice out there
In a tree
My mama bear
Will be all right
With proper care

Hey hey hey do

Boomerang
Into a bigger bang
A little cry of love
Because they cannot sing
Cherokee
What did the pharaoh see
Another time and space
Another place to be

The motive
The measure
The purpose
The pleasure

The risk is
It worth it
The disc is
It perfect

I found you
Amongst them
The flower
With young stem

Disparage
The broken
The marriage
Alopin'

#27. Turn It Again
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Some of us get a little
And some a lot
We've got to make due
With whatever we got
We get it hot we cool it down
And then we pass it around

You can dance
For the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid
Of whatever's in your way
Next stop big hop
Is turning night into day

Sometimes when
I'm lying there all alone
I think of every little nothing
That we could own
To overthrow all of you
Who have overgrown

All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again

Let’s dance all night and day now
Get down and show the way how
I want to show you that I care

Two things I want to say now
You make it all ok now
I need to know that you are there

I've come to learn
Whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into
Whatever light we bend
Out on the street
I get a beat and then
I turn it to ten

Lace boots and the
Ladies of Kazakhstan
Kick 'em high to the sky
All of this just because we can
I turn to Cuba
Then Aruba then the Dominican

We've got to move it
If we want to do our best
We've got to shake it
If we want to keep it fresh

I'm turning down
All the heavy psychology
To cut a rug
And I make no apology
I turn a cheek, I turn a key
And then I turn it for free

We've got to move it
Just a little to hit the spot
A whirling dervish in a flurry
A fox to trot
Come clown around, a robot
Doin' the astronaut

#28. Death Of A Martian
Songwriters: 
Cover: 

Bear paws and rascal power
Watching us in your garage
Big girl you ate the neighbor
The nova is over
Wake up and play
Balleradio
Make room for Clara's bare feet
The love of a Martian

Tick tock and waiting for the meteor
This clock is opening another door

Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I've lost today
And these are the things that I

Blood flowers in the kitchen
Signing off and winding down
This Martian ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards, bark at donkeys
The love of a Martian

Let's bow our heads
And let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone
God bless her little soul

She’s got a sword in case though this is not her lord in case the one who can’t afford to face her image is restored to grace. Disappeared. No trace. Musky tears. Suitcase. The down turn brave little burncub bearcareless turnip snare rampages pitch color pages…. down and out but not in Vegas. Disembarks and disengages. No loft. Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude for the sniffing black noses that snort and allude to the dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its. It's for you. Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck muscles and bottlenosed grifters arrive in time to catch the late show. It's a beehive barrel race. A shehive stare and chase wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her. Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost. The kind that you find when you mind your own mysteries. Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the newmorning milk blanket. Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay. Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesternights fallen freckles…. away…
